# Parcel List

#### Technologies that were used:

Webpack, ReactJS, CSS/SCSS

#### How to start the application:

1. You can clone this repository: https://github.com/AlexPopov03/Gotoinc-Test-Task-Code.git in your brand new folder and open it in code editor

2. Start your code editor. In the initial window, select the Clone repository section. Enter or specify the location of the repository, and then click the Clone button

#### Application logic:

The user should enters the parcel data in form, as: *departure city, receiving city, type of parcel, date of dispatch and parcel description*

Then add this parcel data in parcel list under the form by using the button *'Add parcel'*. Form has **important fields (*)**, as:  *departure city, receiving city and date of dispatch* and **non important**: *type of parcel and parcel description*

If user won`t fill one of **important fields (*)**, user will have a modal window which tells the user that an error has occurred and he needs to fill in all the **important fields (*)**. User can close this modal window by using the button *'Close'* or click on backdrop (aroud the modal window)

Every parcel has *'Delete'* button, which allows the user to delete the selected parcel from the list

Same way, each package has its own *"Parcel number"*, which is displayed as the first element in the parcel
